# AngularJS demo application which display list of repositories for given user

## Prerequisites
You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).
Otherwise, you won't be able tu run the tests and you will have to launch webserver yourself


## Getting Started
1. Clone or just download and extract the project.
2. Browse the project in console and type "npm run setup" It will automatically install node_modules and bower_components.
3. Execute unit tests via "npm run test". It should execute all the unit tests once, and display the result in console.
4. Start application via "npm run server" on just "npm start". It starts webserver on port 8080. Make sure its free first.

## From author
Presented solution might be further automated, but I tried to keep it simple and avoid depending the project on to many third party libs.
There is no LESS/SASS preprocessor and no Grunt/Gulp/Webpack as it was focussed on app functionality.
